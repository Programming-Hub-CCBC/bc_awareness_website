1,A breast cancer gene is inheritable.,True or False,TRUE,Abortions are not linked to breast cancer and most studies show no increased risk with modern day lower dose birth control pills.
2,What are families who show patterns of mutated genes referred to?,,Mutant families,A government task force did recently recommend that mammograms aren’t necessary under age 50. But many experts in the field believe these recommendations are based on faulty analysis.
3,What percentage of people contract breast cancer because of mutated genes?,,0.1,"Early detection and treatment is key for breast cancer survival. Yet most survey respondents placed too much faith in self-examinations and mammograms . Mammograms are among the best diagnostic tools we have, but they are imperfect, revealing too many false positives and thus leading to worry and to unnecessary procedures. Mammograms also miss a surprising number of real, malignant cancers."
4,Name the two mutated genes that cause breast cancer.,,BRCA1 and BRCA2,"Most breast cancer is diagnosed in an early stage during a mammogram, before any symptoms occur. If any symptoms do occur, most of them turn out to be benign. However, you should still see a doctor immediately."
5,What is the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2?,,BRCA1 is found to cause both breast and ovarian cancer (prostate in males). BRCA2 only causes breast.,"A mamograms purpose is to find breast cancer early, before any symptoms can develop and the cancer usually is easier to treat."
6,80% of women with breast cancer have no family history.,True or False,TRUE,"Diagnostic tests are used to determine whether or not breast cancer is present and, if so, whether or not it has traveled outside the breast. Diagnostic tests also are used to gather more information about the cancer to guide decisions about treatment."
7,"250,000 women with breast cancer are diagnosed before they are 40 years of age.",True or False,TRUE,Diagnostic tests are used during and after treatment to monitor how well therapies are working. Monitoring tests also may be used to check for any signs of recurrence.
8,"Using birth control pills can cause breast cancer, so can having an abortion",True or False,FALSE,"You should examine yourself several days after your period ends, when your breasts are least likely to be swollen and tender. If you are no longer having periods, choose a day that's easy to remember, such as the first or last day of the month."
9,New guidelines suggest mammograms are not necessary every year.,True or False,FALSE,20% percentage of breast cancer is identified through self examination
10,Self Examinations and Mammograms are the Solution to Breast Cancer,True or False,FALSE,"The upper, outer area — near your armpit is the part of the breast would you expect to find the most ""lumps"" and ""bumps""."
11,Which cancer is the second leading cause of death in women in the united states,,Breast Cancer ,"Mammography misses at least 10 percent of breast cancer. So if you feel a lump that doesn't show up on a mammogram, bring it to your doctor's attention. Get it evaluated."
12,Approximately how many American women have survived breast cancer?,,About 1.6 million have survived and are alive today!,"A woman has about a one in eight chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute."
13,What is the estimated percentage of women that survive cancer when detected in the earliest stages.,,0.9,Most women (about eight out of 10) who get breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease
14,"A woman's risk of breast cancer is higher if her mother, sister or daughter had breast cancer.",True or False,TRUE,"Minimize alcohol intake to control risk. That means one glass of wine, one beer or one hard liquor drink per day. (Drinking seven drinks in one day and none the rest of the week is not OK.)"
15,What are the most common symptoms of early breast cancer?,,Most symtoms are indicative of cancer,"Exercise reduces breast cancer risk for women of all body types — even lean women, according to Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., director of biomarkers of early detection and prevention at City of Hope. Exercise is also beneficial to breast cancer survivors."
16,When are screening tests (mammograms) performed on patients?,,Screening tests are routine for people who appear to be healthy and are not suspected of having breast cancer,"Herceptin, a breast cancer “smart drug,” can trace its roots to City of Hope: Scientists there developed engineered human proteins that led to monoclonal antibodies, the basis of multiple cancer drugs."
17,When would a patient require a diagnostic test?,,"Diagnostic tests (such as biopsy) are given to people who are suspected of having breast cancer, either because of symptoms they may be experiencing or a screening test result.",The movement away from one-size-fits all screening doesn’t mean you should skip your mammogram. Talk with your physician to evaluate your personal risk of breast cancer. The American Cancer Society continues to recommend women should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screenings with mammograms at age 40.
18,Would a patient who was not yet diagnosed with breast cancer require annual monitoring tests?,,"No, breast cancer would first need to be diagnosed.",Women who have had more menstrual cycles because they started menstruating early (especially before age 12) or went through menopause later (after age 55) have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer — likely because of a longer lifetime exposure to the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
19,What is the name of the procedure that is used to remove the part of the breast that has cancer and some normal tissue around it.,,Partial Masectomy,Women with dense breasts (more glandular and fibrous tissue and less fatty tissue) on mammograms have a risk of breast cancer that is about 1.5 to 2 times that of women with average breast density
20,"What is the name of the cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.",,Chemotherapy,"While the American Cancer Society recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to manage risk, for some, even 30 minutes per week has been found to be beneficial, Bernstein’s research has found."
21,How often should you perform a self examination of your breasts?,,Once a Month,Women of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage are at higher risk of having BRCA mutation.
